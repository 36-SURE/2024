Why should people care about your work?\n  \n  - You want to build up what your work is trying to address\n\n. . .\n\nExample: [Ron's nflWAR talk at NESSIS 2017](https://youtu.be/djD-yL3vWNQ):\n\n  - Do **NOT** begin with: \"We're introducing [project topic]\" (WAR for NFL)\n  \n  - Instead begin with current state of NFL analytics and need for better, reproducible player level-metrics\n\n. . .\n  \nDo **NOT** include an outline slide!\n\n  - Your presentation should flow naturally \n  \n. . .\n\n[Or you can begin with a \"creative\" intro...](https://youtu.be/_MAs16nqVdw)\n\n\n## Describing the data\n\nYou want to provide a general overview of your dataset:\n\n  - What are your observations? i.e., what does each row of your dataset represent?\n\n. . .\n  \n  - What are the relevant variables/features? i.e., what are the columns of interest?\n  \n    - Be careful though with many variables - avoid just listing everything!\n    \n    - Simplify by describing groups of variables together\n    \n. . .\n\n**Use examples** - makes your data explicit and concrete for the audience\n\n  - But do **NOT** print out raw `R` console output or screenshots of output!\n  \n  - Use text or a clean formatted table (via e.g., `knitr`, [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/), etc.)\n  \n\n## Introducing and describing methods\n\n- Prior to presenting results, you want to clearly state any transformations and methods used in the analysis\n\n- Your presentation should provide the general steps for someone to replicate your work\n\n  - e.g., Used complete-linkage hierarchical clustering with [INSERT VARIABLES], determined $k$ number of clusters by [INSERT REASON]\n  \n  - e.g., Modeled [INSERT RESPONSE VARIABLE] as a function of [INSERT EXPLANATORY VARIABLES]\n  \n. . .\n\n- For more complicated methods, you'll want to provide a brief review of the methodology\n\n- If introducing new methodology: **walk through the steps clearly**\n\n. . .\n\n- **Always justify your choice of methodology**\n\n  - Why you used a flexible tree-based model over linear regression\n  \n\n\n## Presenting results\n\n- Use the [**assertion-evidence**]( https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/other-resources/handouts/comm-supp-pdfs/designing-powerpoint-slides.pdf) model\n\n- **Assertion**: title of the slide should be the key takeaway in brief sentence form\n\n  - Indicates the point of the visualization or whatever means used to display the results\n\n- **Evidence**: the body of the slide containing the results\n\n  - Display of the results in some format that is simple to explain and understand\n  \n. . .\n\n- Limit the amount of text in your **Evidence** portion - brief statements with important context\n\n- Treat the **Assertion** as the title of your **Evidence**\n\n  - Plot titles are then redundant and not necessary with an effective assertion\n\n\n\n## Assertion\n\n<center>\n\n<br>\n\n<font size=\"+10\">\n\nEvidence\n\n</font>\n\n(e.g., plots, animations, tables, etc.)\n\n<br>\n\n</center>\n\n\n## MLB strikeout rates have been increasing throughout history\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](09-presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n(Explain the `aes` of your graph - what is each axis, color, shape, etc referring to? And what is the unit scale?)\n\n\n\n## Discussion (and ending a presentation)\n\n- Conclude with a recap of the main points of your work\n\n. . .\n\n- Then point out **limitations** and indicate **future directions**\n\n. . .\n\n- Either end with the **Discussion** slide (or **Acknowledgements** but this is sometimes placed at the beginning)\n\n- Never end a presentation with lone *Thank you* slide! \n\n  - Want the audience to focus on the final points in your **Discussion** slide\n  \n. . .\n\n- Include back-up **Appendix** slides with additional info, ready for questions\n\n. . .\n\n- Slides for **References** should not be displayed during your talk\n\n  - Their purpose is just for sharing with others\n  \n  - Alternative option: include references directly on slides either in text or via footnotes ^[Like this...]\n\n\n\n\n## Additional tips and reminders\n\n**Use pauses effectively** to highlight points and explain steps\n\n. . .\n\n- Showing all of your text at once can overwhelm your audience\n\n. . .\n\nBut\n\n. . .\n\ndon't\n\n. . .\n\nbe \n\n. . .\n\nridiculous\n\n. . .\n\nRemember: **memory overload is real!**\n\n- Do **NOT** introduce too much notation at once\n\n- **Repetitive language and usage of words are useful and reminders for the audience**\n\n  - Use consistent language and terminology throughout the talk\n\n. . .\n\n**Know your audience!**\n\n## Design tips\n\n* Less ink, less ink, less ink\n\n* Your plot should be big enough (font size, line width, point size, etc.)\n\n* Reformat variable names (don't show the original names in the data)\n\n* If a table can be represented by a figure, turn it into a figure (e.g., comparison of model evaluation metrics)\n\n## More general tips\n\n> Your slides should support what you say, not create interference between speech and vision brain areas -- your slides serves as a summary of what you said so someone who may have been distracted can catch up quickly.\n\n> Do not create your talk at the last minute (it will be obvious if you do). Designing good slides takes time. Practicing a talk takes time. \n\n* [Advices from Andrew Patton:](https://x.com/anpatt7/status/1746209633562443948)\n\n> You don’t need 17 decimal points for anything ever.\n\n> Make sure your figures and charts, etc. all display the correct size. If I have to zoom in 27 times to read the legends that’s not going to help your case.\n\n> Pick better colors for your charts. Your submission should look expensive.\n\n# Do it live: presentation critique\n\n# Do it live: making presentations with Quarto\n\n## Resources to follow along\n\n* Quarto presentation: [`quarto.org/docs/presentations`](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/)\n\n* `revealjs`: [`quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs`](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)\n",
