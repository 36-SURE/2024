We will then provide feedback.\n\n**Monday, June 17 at 5pm ET** - Slides and full code must be completed and ready for presentation. Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`; but the slides may be created in any software. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore online resources that may be relevant.\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset contains information on health indicators for 29 counties in Utah in 2014. The data are available online at the [State of Utah Open Data Catalog](https://opendata.utah.gov/) website. The provided dataset is a cleaned version of the original data (which can be found [here](https://opendata.utah.gov/Health/Health-Care-Indicators-By-Counties-In-Utah-2014/qmsu-gki4)).\n\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a county in Utah and the columns are:\n\n-   `County`: name of the county in Utah\n-   `Population`: county population\n-   `PercentUnder18`: percent of county population that is under 18\n-   `PercentOver65`: percent of county population that is 65 and over\n-   `DiabeticRate`: diabetic rate\n-   `HIVRate`: hive rate\n-   `PrematureMortalityRate`: premature mortality rate\n-   `InfantMortalityRate`: infant mortality rate\n-   `ChildMortalityRate`: child mortality rate\n-   `LimitedAccessToFood`: limited access to food %\n-   `FoodInsecure`: % food insecure\n-   `MotorDeathRate`: motor vehicle mortality rate\n-   `DrugDeathRate`: drug poisoning mortality rate\n-   `Uninsured`: % uninsured\n-   `UninsuredChildren`: % uninsured children\n-   `HealthCareCosts`: cost of healthcare\n-   `CouldNotSeeDr`: % could not see doctor due to cost\n-   `MedianIncome`: median household income\n-   `ChildrenFreeLunch`: % children eligible for free lunch\n-   `HomicideRate`: homicide rate\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nutah_health <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/36-SURE.github.io/main/data/utah_health.csv\")\n```\n:::",
