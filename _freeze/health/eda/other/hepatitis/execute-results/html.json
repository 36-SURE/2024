We will then provide feedback.\n\n**Monday, June 17 at 5pm ET** - Slides and full code must be completed and ready for presentation. Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`; but the slides may be created in any software. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore online resources that may be relevant.\n\n## Data\n\nThis datasets contains laboratory measurements of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients. The data were obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data), with the original source coming from the article [*Using machine learning techniques to generate laboratory diagnostic pathwaysâ€”a case study*](https://jlpm.amegroups.org/article/view/4401/5425), published in Journal of Laboratory and Precision Medicine.\n\nEach row in the dataset represents a patient and the columns are:\n\n-   `...1`: patient ID number\n-   `Category`: diagnosis (`0=Blood Donor`, `0s=suspect Blood Donor`, `1=Hepatitis`, `2=Fibrosis`, `3=Cirrhosis`)\n-   `Age`: age (in years)\n-   `Sex`: sex (male or female)\n-   `ALB`: albumin blood test\n-   `ALP`: alkaline phosphatase\n-   `ALT`: alanine transaminase\n-   `AST`: aspartate transaminase\n-   `BIL`: bilirubin\n-   `CHE`: acetylcholinesterase\n-   `CHOL`: cholesterol\n-   `CREA`: creatinine\n-   `GGT`: gamma-glutamyl transferase\n-   `PROT`: proteins\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nhepatitis <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/2024/main/data/hepatitis.csv\")\n```\n:::",
