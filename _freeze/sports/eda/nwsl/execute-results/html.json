We will then provide feedback.\n\n**Monday, June 17 at 5pm ET** - Slides and full code must be completed and ready for presentation. Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`; but the slides may be created in any software. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore online resources that may be relevant. (But be sure to always consult the `R` help documentation first before attempting to google around or ask ChatGPT.)\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset contains regular season statistics for each NWSL team from 2016 to 2022 (excluding 2020 which was cancelled due to COVID). The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) is the top professional womenâ€™s soccer league in the United States. The data was collected using the [`nwslR` package in `R`](https://github.com/nwslR/nwslR).\n\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a team-season and the columns are:\n\n-   `team_name`: name of NWSL team\n-   `season`: regular season year of team's statistics\n-   `games_played`: number of games team played in season\n-   `goal_differential`: goals scored - goals conceded\n-   `goals`: number of goals scores\n-   `goals_conceded`: number of goals conceded\n-   `cross_accuracy`: percent of crosses that were successful\n-   `goal_conversion_pct`: percent of shots scored\n-   `pass_pct`: pass accuracy\n-   `pass_pct_opposition_half`: pass accuracy in opposition half\n-   `possession_pct`: percentage of overall ball possession the team had during the season\n-   `shot_accuracy`: percentage of shots on target\n-   `tackle_success_pct`: percent of successful tackles\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nnwsl_team_stats <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/2024/main/data/nwsl_team_stats.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn case you're curious, the code to build the data can be found [here](https://github.com/SCOREnetworkorg/sports-data-repository/blob/main/_prep/nwsl-team-stats/init-nwsl-team-season-stats.R).\n",
