We will then provide feedback.\n\n**Monday, June 17 at 5pm ET** - Slides and full code must be completed and ready for presentation. Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`; but the slides may be created in any software. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore online resources that may be relevant. (But be sure to always consult the `R` help documentation first before attempting to google around or ask ChatGPT.)\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset contains all passing plays from the 2023 NFL regular season accessed via the [`nflfastR`](https://www.nflfastr.com) package (part of the [`nflverse`](https://nflverse.nflverse.com/)).\n\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a single passing play (including [sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack)) and the columns are:\n\n-   `passer_player_name`: name for the player that attempted the pass\n-   `passer_player_id`: unique identifier for the player that attempted the pass\n-   `posteam`: abbreviation for the team with possession\n-   `complete_pass`: indicator denoting whether or not the pass was completed\n-   `interception`: indicator denoting whether or not the pass was intercepted by the defense\n-   `yards_gained`: yards gained (or lost) by the possessing team, excluding yards gained via fumble recoveries and laterals\n-   `touchdown`: indicator denoting if the play resulted in a touchdown\n-   `pass_location`: categorical location of pass\n-   `pass_length`: categorical length of pass\n-   `air_yards`: distance in yards perpendicular to the line of scrimmage at where the targeted receiver either caught or didn't catch the ball\n-   `yards_after_catch`: distance in yards perpendicular to the yard line where the receiver made the reception to where the play ended\n-   `epa`: expected points added (EPA) by the posteam for the given play\n-   `wpa`: win probability added (WPA) for the posteam\n-   `shotgun`: indicator for whether or not the play was in shotgun formation\n-   `no_huddle`: indicator for whether or not the play was in no_huddle formation\n-   `qb_dropback`: indicator for whether or not the QB dropped back on the play (pass attempt, sack, or scrambled)\n-   `qb_hit`: indicator if the QB was hit on the play\n-   `sack`: indicator for if the play ended in a sack\n-   `receiver_player_name`: name for the targeted receiver\n-   `receiver_player_id`: unique identifier for the receiver that was targeted on the pass\n-   `defteam`: abbreviation for the team on defense\n-   `posteam_type`: indicating whether the posteam team is home or away\n-   `play_id`: unique identifier for a single play\n-   `yardline_100`: distance in the number of yards from the opponent's endzone for the posteam\n-   `side_of_field`: abbreviation for which team's side of the field the team with possession is currently on\n-   `down`: down for the given play\n-   `qtr`: quarter of the game (5 is overtime)\n-   `play_clock`: time on the playclock when the ball was snapped\n-   `half_seconds_remaining`: seconds remaining in the half\n-   `game_half`: indicating which half the play is in\n-   `game_id`: ten digit identifier for NFL game\n-   `home_team`: abbreviation for the home team\n-   `away_team`: abbreviation for the away team\n-   `home_score`: total points scored by the home team\n-   `away_score`: total points scored by the away team\n-   `desc`: detailed description for the given play\n\nNote that a full glossary of the features available for NFL play-by-play data can be found [here](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/field_descriptions.html).\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nnfl_passing <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/2024/main/data/nfl_passing.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn case you're curious, the code to build this dataset can be found below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflfastR) # install.packages(\"nflverse\")\nnfl_pbp <- load_pbp(2023)\nnfl_passing <- nfl_pbp |> \n  filter(play_type == \"pass\", season_type == \"REG\", \n         !is.na(epa), !is.na(posteam), posteam != \"\") |> \n  select(# player info attempting the pass\n         passer_player_name, passer_player_id, posteam,\n         # info about the pass:\n         complete_pass, interception, yards_gained, touchdown,\n         pass_location, pass_length, air_yards, yards_after_catch, epa, wpa,\n         shotgun, no_huddle, qb_dropback, qb_hit, sack,\n         # context about the receiver:\n         receiver_player_name, receiver_player_id,\n         # team context\n         posteam, defteam, posteam_type,\n         # play and game context\n         play_id, yardline_100, side_of_field, down, qtr, play_clock,\n         half_seconds_remaining, game_half, game_id,\n         home_team, away_team, home_score, away_score,\n         # description of play\n         desc)\n```\n:::",
