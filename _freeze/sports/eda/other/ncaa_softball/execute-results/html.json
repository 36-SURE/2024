We will then provide feedback on the code submitted.\n\n**Monday, June 17 at 11:59pm ET** - Slides and full code must be completed and ready for presentation. Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore material online that may be relevant!\n\n## Data\n\n-   `game_id`: game ID\n-   `team`: pitching team\n-   `opponent`: batting team\n-   `player`: pitcher\n-   `ip`: innings pitched (number of innings a pitcher remains in a game)\n-   `ha`: hits allowed\n-   `er`: earned runs\n-   `bb`: batted balls\n-   `hb`: hit by pitch\n-   `so`: strikeout\n-   `bf`: batters faced\\\n-   `hr_a`: home runs allowed\n-   `go`: ground outs\n-   `fo`: fly outs\\\n-   `season`: year of the season\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"tmking2002/softballR\")\nncaa_softball_pitching_2023 <- softballR::load_ncaa_softball_playerbox(season = 2023, category = \"Pitching\")\n# scoreboard <- softballR::load_ncaa_softball_scoreboard(season = 2023)\n# write_csv(ncaa_softball_pitching_2023, \"data/ncaa_softball_pitching_2023.csv\")\n```\n:::",
