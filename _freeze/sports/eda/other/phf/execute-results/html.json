We will then provide feedback on the code submitted.\n\n**Monday, June 17 at 11:59pm ET** - Slides and full code must be completed and ready for presentation. Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore material online that may be relevant!\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset contains shot information during the 2021-2022 PHF season. The [Premier Hockey Federation (PHF)](https://www.premierhockeyfederation.com/) (2015-2023) was a professional women's ice hockey league in North America. Recently, more data has become available for people to explore and join the [women's hockey analytics community](https://www.whkyhac.com/). The data were collected using the [`fastRhockey` package in `R`](https://fastrhockey.sportsdataverse.org/index.html) and include the following columns:\n\n-   `play_description`: string detailed description of event\n-   `play_type`: string denoting the outcome of the shot, either `Goal`, `PP Goal` (meaning power play goal), `SH Goal`, (meaning shorthanded goal), `Shot` (shot saved by goalie), or `Shot BLK` (meaning blocked by a non-goalie)\n-   `period_id`: integer value of the game period\n-   `time_remaining` String display of time remaining in period in `MM:SS` format where `MM` and `SS` denotes minutes and seconds remaning respectively\n-   `sec_from_start` Numeric value of the seconds since the start of the game\n-   `home_team`: string name of the home team\n-   `away_team`: string name of the away team\n-   `home_goals`: integer value of the home team score after the event\n-   `away_goals`: integer value of the away team score after the event\n-   `shooting_team`: string defining the team taking the shot\n-   `player_name_1`: string name of the player taking the shot\n-   `player_name_2`: string name of the secondary event player (blocker or goalie)\n-   `goalie_involved`: string name of the goalie involved in the shot attempt\n-   `shot_result`: string denoting the outcome of the shot, either `blocked` (meaning blocked by a non-goalie), `made` (goal), or `saved` (shot on net that was saved by a goalie)\n-   `on_ice_situation`: string indicator for game strength: `Even Strength` or `Power Play`\n-   `home_score_total`: integer value of the home team score at the end of the game\n-   `away_score_total`: integer value of the away team score at the end of the game\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(fastRhockey)\nphf_pbp <- load_phf_pbp(2021)\nphf_shots <- phf_pbp |> \n  # do not include miss, these were only recorded for a few game\n  filter(play_type %in% c(\"Goal\", \"PP Goal\", \"SH Goal\", \"Shot\", \"Shot BLK\")) %>%\n  select(play_description, play_type, period_id, time_remaining, \n         sec_from_start, home_team, away_team, home_goals, away_goals, \n         shooting_team = team, player_name_1, player_name_2, goalie_involved,\n         shot_result, on_ice_situation, home_score_total, away_score_total)\n```\n:::",
