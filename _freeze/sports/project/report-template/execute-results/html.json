You should also include descriptions of any major data pre-processing/cleaning steps.\n\n## Methods\n\nDescribe the modeling techniques you chose, their assumptions, justifications for why they are appropriate for the problem, and your plan for comparison/evaluation approaches.\n\n## Results\n\nDescribe your results. This can include tables and plots showing your results, as well as text describing how your models worked and the appropriate interpretations of the relevant output. (Note: Don’t just write out the textbook interpretations of all model coefficients! Instead, interpret the output that is relevant for your question of interest that is framed in the introduction)\n\n## Discussion\n\nGive your conclusions and summarize what you have learned with regards to your question of interest. Are there any limitations with the approaches you used? What do you think are the next steps to follow-up your project?\n\n## Appendix: A quick tutorial\n\n**(Feel free to remove this section when you submit)**\n\nThis a Quarto document. \nTo learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.\nYou can use the Render button to see what it looks like in HTML.\n\n### Text formatting\n\nText can be bolded with **double asterisks** and italicized with *single asterisks*. \nMonospace text, such as for short code snippets, uses `backticks`.\n(Note these are different from quotation marks or apostrophes.) Links are\nwritten [like this](http://example.com/).\n\nBulleted lists can be written with asterisks:\n\n* Each item starts on a new line with an asterisk.\n* Items should start on the beginning of the line.\n* Leave blank lines after the end of the list so the list does not continue.\n\nMathematics can be written with LaTeX syntax using dollar signs. \nFor instance, using single dollar signs we can write inline math: $(-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})/2a$.\n\nTo write math in \"display style\", i.e. displayed on its own line centered on the\npage, we use double dollar signs:\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 1\n$$\n\n\n### Code blocks\n\nCode blocks are evaluated sequentially when you hit Render. \nAs the code runs, `R` prints out which block is running, so naming blocks is useful if you want to know which one takes a long time. \nAfter the block name, you can specify [chunk options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/). \nFor example, `echo` controls whether the code is printed in the document. \nBy default, output is printed in the document in monospace:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nChunk options can also be written inside the code block, which is helpful for really long options, as we'll see soon.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Figures\n\nIf a code block produces a plot or figure, this figure will automatically be inserted inline in the report. That is, it will be inserted exactly where the code block is.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This is a caption.
